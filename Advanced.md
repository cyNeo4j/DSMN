# Advanced users:
- Check out how to build this project in Eclipse [here](https://cyneo4j.github.io/DSMN/eclipse) .

- Information on setting up Neo4j (community edition) can be found [here](https://cyneo4j.github.io/DSMN/neo4j).

- You can upload (new) pathway data yourself from Eclipse to Neo4j. Follow the order of the java classes (1 to 4) to perform the data download from RDF format ([class 1](https://cyneo4j.github.io/DSMN/RDFquery)), integration between databases ([class 2](https://cyneo4j.github.io/DSMN/DataMerge)), upload to Neo4j ([class 3](https://cyneo4j.github.io/DSMN/DataTransfer)) and shortest path query ([class 4](https://cyneo4j.github.io/DSMN/DataQuery)). 

- Writing new queries on the existing data can be a bit easier following [these tips](https://cyneo4j.github.io/DSMN/DataQueryAdvanced).

- The CyNeo4j App code can be found [here](https://github.com/cyNeo4j/cyNeo4j).
