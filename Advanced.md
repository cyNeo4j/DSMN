# Advanced users:
- Check out how to build this project in Eclipse [here](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/0_DSMN%20setup%20in%20Eclipse.md) .

- Information on setting up Neo4j (community edition) can be found [here](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/0_Neo4j%20(community)%20setup.md).

- You can upload (new) pathway data yourself from Eclipse to Neo4j. Follow the order of the java classes (1 to 4) to perform the data download from RDF format ([class 1](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/1_RDF%20query%20data%20Blazegraph%20(Class%201).md)), integration between databases (class 2), upload to Neo4j ([class 3](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/Editing%203_Neo4j%20Upload%20data%20(Class%203).md))) and shortest path query (class 4). 

- Writing new queries on the existing data can be a bit easier following [these tips](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/4_Neo4j%20Query%20data%20(Class%204%20or%20Neo4j%20Browser).md).

- The CyNeo4j App code can be found [here](https://github.com/cyNeo4j/cyNeo4j).
