## Discovering lifeâ€™s directed metabolic (sub)paths to interpret biochemical markers

Welcome to the DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork(DSMN) extended documentation. View the website [here](https://cyneo4j.github.io/DSMN/) .

Minimum System Requirements:
- Neo4j [3.5.x](https://neo4j.com/download-center/#community)
- Cytoscape [3.9.x](https://cytoscape.org/download.html) (automatically comes with a Java 11 download)
- CyNeo4j [2.x](https://github.com/cyNeo4j/cyNeo4j/releases)

You can find all the documents, scripts [here](https://github.com/cyNeo4j/DSMN).

# Quick start:
- Information on setting up Neo4j (community edition) can be found [here](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/0_Neo4j%20(community)%20setup.md).

- Download Cytoscape [here](https://cytoscape.org/download.html).

- Download the CyNeo4j App [online](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cyneo4j) or from within Cytoscape.

- Run your query!

# Advanced users:
- Check out how to build this project in Eclipse [here](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/0_DSMN%20setup%20in%20Eclipse.md) .

- Information on setting up Neo4j (community edition) can be found [here](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/0_Neo4j%20(community)%20setup.md).

- You can upload (new) pathway data yourself from Eclipse to Neo4j. Follow the order of the java classes (1 to 4) to perform the data download from RDF format ([class 1](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/1_RDF%20query%20data%20Blazegraph%20(Class%201).md)), integration between databases (class 2), upload to Neo4j ([class 3](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/Editing%203_Neo4j%20Upload%20data%20(Class%203).md))) and shortest path query (class 4). 

- Writing new queries on the existing data can be a bit easier following [these tips](https://github.com/mkutmon/DirectedSmallMoleculesNetwork/blob/master/docs/4_Neo4j%20Query%20data%20(Class%204%20or%20Neo4j%20Browser).md).

- The CyNeo4j App code can be found [here](https://github.com/cyNeo4j/cyNeo4j).
